# browser-oembed-parser

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm i

# or pnpm, yarn
```

Start server:

```bash
npm start
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:3102/` to test.


### Note

Basically `oembed-parser` only works at server side.

However there are some noble providers those enable `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` on their service.
For example with oembed links from YouTube, TED or CodeSandbox, we can parse from browser.
